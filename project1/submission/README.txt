ECE 358: Project 1 - Queue Simulation

Use the makefile in /src to create two executables: simulator-inf and simulator-fin

To create the infinite buffer executable: make simulator-inf
To create the finite buffer executable: make simulator-fin

To clean directory: make clean

To run simulator-inf: ./simulator-inf 
To run simulator-fin: ./simulator-fin

The simulation runs for 11000 seconds (T = 11000)
Lambda is set to be obtained from roh = lambda*(L/C)
Alpha is obtained from lambda + 10, to ensure more observers are generated

Total time for finite buffer simulation should be around 10-11 mins (on eceubuntu)
Total time for infinite buffer simulation should be around 1-2 mins on (on eceubuntu)
